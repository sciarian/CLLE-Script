# CLLE-Script
This program will scrape throught the cellosourus portal on expasy.org for cell line cancer patients. The script will pull the 
age, gender, race, and earliest year mentioned for each cell line. If no information is found for any of the attributes of a
cell line then 'U' will be used to show that the value for the attribute is unkown.
